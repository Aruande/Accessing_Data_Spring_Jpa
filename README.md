# Accessing Data with Spring JPA

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Spring Data JPA** to perform CRUD operations and manage database interactions in a Java-based application. It showcases object-relational mapping (ORM) and repository patterns for seamless integration with a relational database.

## Features
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Integration with a relational database
- Use of JPA annotations for entity mapping
- Implementation of Spring Boot repository interfaces
- Focus on scalability and maintainability

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building backend applications
- **Spring Data JPA**: Module for database interactions
- **H2 Database**: Lightweight, in-memory database for testing
- **Maven**: Build automation tool

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aruande/Accessing_Data_Spring_Jpa.git
   
## How It Works
1. **Entities**: JPA annotations define the structure of database tables.
2. **Repositories**: Interfaces extend `JpaRepository` to handle CRUD operations.
3. **Application Logic**: Controllers interact with repositories to process requests.

## Future Enhancements
- Add RESTful API endpoints for external integration.
- Connect to a cloud-based database (e.g., AWS RDS).
- Add unit tests to ensure code reliability.
